	"abdominal cavity Largest hollow space of the body, between the dia¬  phragm and the top of the pelvic cavity and surrounded by the spine and  the abdominal muscles and others. It contains most of the alimentary canal,  the liver and pancreas, the spleen, the kidneys, and the adrenal glands. It is  lined by the peritoneum, a membrane covering the cavity’s inside wall  (parietal peritoneum) and each organ or structure in it (visceral perito¬  neum). Disorders include ascites (fluid in the peritoneal cavity) and peri¬  tonitis.",
	" Allied Powers or Allies Nations allied in opposition to the Central  Powers in World War I or to the Axis Powers in World War II. The origi¬  nal Allies in World War I—the British Empire, France, and the Russian  Empire—were later joined by many other countries, including Portugal,  Japan, and Italy. Other nations joining the Allies, including the U.S. after  1917, were called Associated Powers",

	"analysis In chemistry, the determination of the properties and compo¬  sition of samples of materials; qualitative analysis establishes what is  there, and quantitative analysis measures how much. A large body of sys¬  tematic procedures (analytical chemistry) has evolved in close associa¬  tion with other branches of the physical sciences since their beginnings.  A sample of a single compound may be analyzed to establish its elemen¬  tal composition (see element, molecular weight) or molecular structure;  many measurements use spectroscopy and spectrophotometry. A mixed  sample is usually analyzed by separating, detecting, and identifying its  components by methods that depend on differences in their properties  (e.g., volatility, mobility in an electric or gravitational field, distribution  between liquids that do not mix).",
	" However, even rare sexual reproduction events can generate an important genetic diversification because a single sexual reproduction event is able to generate numerous genotypes that can vegetatively propagate rapidly. Heterozygosity observed inV. planifolia was reported to be 0–0.078 using isozymes (Soto Arenas, 1999), 0.154 using SSR markers (Bory et al., 2008b) and 0.293 using AFLPs (Bory et al., 2008d). Given these heterozygosity levels, even selfing can generate genetic diversity, as demonstrated through manual self-pollination experiments (Bory et al., 2008d) leading to increased diversity estimates (Dmax from 0.106 to 0.140) through novel allelic combinations (Figure 2.3). This is well illustrated in the case ofV. planifolia in areas of introduction, where natural pollinators are absent. In these areas, such as in Reunion Island, traditional cultivation practices involve vine propagation by cuttings, and manual self-pollination to produce pods. This resulted in the appearance of novel vanilla varieties such as the“Aiguille” type observed in Reunion Island, which most likely resulted from accidental seed germination in the field from a forgotten pod, and subsequent vegetative propagation of the individual (Bory et al., 2008d) (Figure 2.3). Such a novel type can rapidly spread in plantations given the vegetative propagation used to multiply vines. This must also happen in the wild. A combination of sexual and vegetative reproduction, where one creates diversity and the other helps settlement, has already been suggested for the speciesV. pompona Schiede andV. bahiana in tropical America based on AFLP patterns (Bory et al., 2008d). Sexual reproduction is therefore a key evolutionary process for most species of the genus despite its low rates and because of their major vegetative reproduction. A few species ofVanilla appear to rely solely on sexual reproduction for propagation. This is the case forV. palmarum, which is entirely epiphytic on a palm ",
	"Collections by past botanists are scarce and illustrations have often been used in place of specimens. This is the case for the“historical herbaria” of theMuséum National d’Histoire Naturelle in Paris. In Lamarck’s herbarium, for example, only one figure illustrates vanilla, taken from theEncyclopédie Méthodique. The legend is in French:Petite vanille ou vanille musquée (small vanilla or vanilla musk). The drawing is sufficiently precise to identifyVanilla palmarum. The Jussieu herbarium is hardly any richer, with only one specimen ofVanilla aromatica. Are these illustrations derived from herbarium specimens? This is doubtful. Drawing from live specimen or from another illustration is common. This significantly contributed to confusion about the genus upon its official publication in the botanical nomenclature",

	"It was just fifteen years earlier that an international consortium of scientists completed the Human Genome Project (HGP), piecing together more or less every page of the book of life, a script of 3.2 billion letters comprised of a four-letter alphabet. A group of researchers at the University of Leicester printed the complete sequence as an encyclopedia of more than one hundred volumes, each chromosome bound in a different color. Those volumes of information are miraculously bundled into twenty-three pairs of chromosomes that reside in trillions of cells in your body. With the human genome sequence at hand, scientists could set about identifying the genes that go awry in literally thousands of rare hereditary diseases, as well as the DNA variants or misspellings that shape our predisposition to common diseases like diabetes, heart disease, and mental illness. Even before this genetic revolution, researchers dreamed of using specific DNA sequences as gene therapy, injecting healthy genes into patients’ cells to compensate for the faulty genes. But the idea of performing DNA surgery—fixing broken genes by cutting and pasting DNA directly into a patient’s genome—was a fantasy",
